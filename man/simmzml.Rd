\usage{
simmzml(
  db,
  name,
  n = 100,
  mzrange = c(100, 1000),
  rtrange = c(0, 600),
  scanrate = 0.2,
  pwidth = 10,
  baseline = 100,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{db}{compound database with MS1 data. e.g. hmdbcms or monams1}

\item{name}{file name of mzml}

\item{n}{compound numbers from database, if compound is not NULL, n will be compund number, default 100}

\item{mzrange}{m/z range for simulation, peaks out of the range will be removed, default c(100,1000)}

\item{rtrange}{retention time range for simulation, default c(0,600)}

\item{scanrate}{time for each full scan, defulat 0.2 secound or 5 spectra per secound}

\item{pwidth}{peak width for the compound. If it's a single value, simulated peaks' width will use this number as the lambda of Poisson distribution. If it's a numeric vector, it will be used as the peak width for each compounds.}

\item{baseline}{noise baseline, default 100}

\item{baselinesd}{standard deviation for noise, default 30}

\item{sn}{signal to noise ratio of each compound, default 100 for all compounds when baseline is 100}

\item{tailingfactor}{tailing factor for peaks, larger means larger tailing, default 1.2}

\item{compound}{numeric compound index in the database for targeted analysis, default NULL}

\item{rtime}{retention time for the compounds, if NULL, retention time will be simulated, default NULL}

\item{tailingindex}{numeric index for tailing compounds, if NULL, all peaks will tailing. Default NULL}

\item{seed}{Random seed for reproducibility}
}
\value{
one mzML file for simulated data and one csv file the simulated compounds with retention time, m/z and name
